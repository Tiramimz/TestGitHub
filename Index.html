  <h4><strong>Background:</strong><h4/>
 <div class="font-size"><ul><li><strong>Childhood: 1918–34 - </strong><em>Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. Given the forename Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term colloquially meaning "troublemaker", in later years he became known by his clan name, Madiba.<em></li>
   <li><strong>Clarkebury, Healdtown, and Fort Hare: 1934–40 - </strong><em>Intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, in 1933 Mandela began his secondary education at Clarkebury Methodist High School, Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland.<em></li>
     <li><strong>Law studies and the ANC Youth League: 1943–49 - </strong><em>Mandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student and faced racism. There, he befriended liberal and communist European, Jewish, and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First. Becoming increasingly politicised, in August 1943 Mandela marched in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises.<em></li>
       <li><strong>Defiance Campaign and Transvaal ANC Presidency: 1950–54- </strong><em>Mandela took Xuma's place on the ANC national executive in March 1950,and that same year was elected national president of the ANCYL. In March, the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg, bringing together African, Indian, and communist activists to call a May Day general strike in protest against apartheid and white minority rule.<em></li>
         <li><strong>Congress of the People and the Treason Trial: 1955–61 - </strong><em>After taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg in February 1955, Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority rule. On his advice, Sisulu requested weaponry from the People's Republic of China, which was denied. Although the Chinese government supported the anti-apartheid struggle, they believed the movement insufficiently prepared for guerilla warfare.<em></li>
            <li><strong>Robben Island: 1964–82- </strong><em>Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years. Isolated from non-political prisoners in Section B, Mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell measuring 8 feet (2.4 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m), with a straw mat on which to sleep.<em></li>
               <li><strong>Continued activism and philanthropy: 1999–2004- </strong><em>Retiring in June 1999, Mandela aimed to lead a quiet family life, divided between Johannesburg and Qunu. Although he set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled The Presidential Years, it was abandoned before publication.<em></li> </ul>
